# Auth

Blade natively offers the [blade-auth](https://github.com/ronin-co/blade/tree/main/packages/blade-auth) package, which provides utility functions for easily adding different authentication methods to your application, without having to maintain them.

The functionality of the package is built around [Triggers](/models/triggers), which make it possible to capture Blade queries and run custom logic.

## Setup

To enable all default authentication features, create the following files in a directory named `triggers` at the root of your application:

```ts
// account.ts

import type { AddTrigger, GetTrigger, RemoveTrigger } from "blade/types";
import { addAccount, setAccount } from "blade/server/auth";

export const add: AddTrigger = addAccount;
export const set: SetTrigger = setAccount;
```

```ts
// session.ts

import type { AddTrigger, GetTrigger, RemoveTrigger } from "blade/types";
import { addSession, getSession, removeSession } from "blade/server/auth";

export const get: GetTrigger = getSession;
export const add: AddTrigger = addSession;
export const remove: RemoveTrigger = removeSession;
```

Additionally, place the following in your [Schema Definition](/models) located in a `schema/index.ts` file at the root of your project:

```ts
export { Account, Session } from 'blade/server/auth';
```

## Status

To obtain the current status of a session, run the following query in a page:

```ts
const session = use.session();
```

To also include the current account, you can run the following:

```ts
const session = use.session.using(['account']);
```

## Actions

To trigger specific actions, you can then run one of the following queries with the [useMutation](/hooks#usemutation-client) hook on the client-side, depending on what actions the user performs.

In addition to the actions documented below, you can, of course, also run any other [Query](/queries) for the models that `blade-auth` provides, such as `Account` and `Session`. For example, you might choose to count records or filter them in a specific way.

### Signing Up

```ts
await add.account.with({
    email: 'elaine@thorne.co',
    password: '1234'
});
```

### Resend Verification Email

```ts
await set.account({
    with: { id: 'xxxx' },
    to: { emailVerificationSentAt: new Date() }
});
```

### Logging Out

```ts
await remove.session();
```

### Reset Account Password

```ts
await set.account({
    with: { email: 'elaine@thorne.co' },
    to: { password: null }
});
```
