# Auth

Blade natively offers the [blade-auth](https://github.com/ronin-co/blade/tree/main/packages/blade-auth) package,
which provides utility functions for easily adding different authentication methods to your application,
without having to maintain them.

The functionality of the package is built around [Triggers](/models/triggers), which make
it possible to capture Blade queries and run custom logic.

## Setup

To enable all default authentication features, create the following files in a directory
named `triggers` at the root of your application.

Additionally, a `BLADE_AUTH_SECRET` environment variable should be present in production
(not necessary during development because a default value is provided there), which must
contain the secret used to sign authentication tokens. You can run `openssl rand -base64 30` to
generate a new secret that you can store in the environment variable.

```ts
// triggers/account.ts

import type {
  AddTrigger,
  SetTrigger,
  FollowingAddTrigger,
  FollowingSetTrigger
} from "blade/types";
import {
  addAccount,
  setAccount,
  followingAddAccount,
  followingSetAccount
} from "blade/server/auth";

export const add: AddTrigger = addAccount;
export const set: SetTrigger = setAccount;

export const followingAdd: FollowingAddTrigger = followingAddAccount;
export const followingSet: FollowingSetTrigger = followingSetAccount;
```

```ts
// triggers/session.ts

import type {
  GetTrigger,
  AddTrigger,
  RemoveTrigger,
  AfterAddTrigger
} from "blade/types";
import {
  addSession,
  getSession,
  removeSession,
  afterAddSession
} from "blade/server/auth";

export const get: GetTrigger = getSession;
export const add: AddTrigger = addSession;
export const remove: RemoveTrigger = removeSession;

export const afterAdd: AfterAddTrigger = afterAddSession;
```

Additionally, place the following in your [Schema Definition](/models) located in
a `schema/index.ts` file at the root of your project:

```ts
export { Account, Session } from 'blade/server/auth';
```

## Status

To obtain the current status of a session, run the following query in a page:

```ts
const session = use.session();
```

To also include the current account, you can run the following:

```ts
const session = use.session.using(['account']);
```

## Actions

To trigger specific actions, you can then run one of the following queries with
the [useMutation](/hooks#usemutation-client) hook on the client-side, depending on what
actions the user performs.

In addition to the actions documented below, you can, of course, also run any
other [Query](/queries) for the models that `blade-auth` provides, such as `Account` and `Session`. For
example, you might choose to count records or filter them in a specific way.

You can choose between either running a **[Query](/hooks#usemutation-client)** or using Blade's **[Form](/components#form)** component.

### Signing Up

This will send the user an email using the `sendEmail` function you've defined. That
email should link them to a page for the [Verifying Email](#verifying-email) step.

This query will automatically set a `account` cookie with the ID of the newly created
account. The login performed in [Verifying Email](#verifying-email) automatically
removes this cookie.

#### Query

```ts
await add.account.with({
    email: 'elaine@thorne.co',
    password: '1234'
});
```

#### Form

```tsx
<Form model="account">
  <Input type="email" name="email" placeholder="Email" />
  <Input type="password" name="password" placeholder="Password" />

  <button type="submit">Sign Up</button>
</Form>
```

### Verifying Email

After clicking the link in the signup email, the user should be taken to a page that can
show some kind of a "Congratulations" message, with a button for continuing to the
logged-in area of the app.

This button should trigger the following query, which validates the email verification
token and logs the user in by creating a session.

No form is available for this action, because there are no visible inputs to fill.

#### Query

```ts
const { searchParams } = useLocation();
const emailVerificationToken = searchParams.get('token');

await add.session.with.account({ emailVerificationToken });
```

### Logging In

If the user would like to manually log in using their email address and password, you can
make that possible using the query below.

This query will automatically set a `session` cookie.

#### Query

```ts
await add.session.with.account({
    email: 'elaine@thorne.co',
    password: '1234'
});
```

#### Form

```tsx
<Form model="session">
  <Input type="email" name="account.email" placeholder="Email" />
  <Input type="password" name="account.password" placeholder="Password" />

  <button type="submit">Log In</button>
</Form>
```

### Logging Out

This query will automatically revoke the `session` cookie.

No form is available for this action, because there are no visible inputs to fill.

```ts
await remove.session();
```

### Forgot Password

Used when the user forgot their password and therefore cannot log in.

#### Query

```ts
await set.account({
  with: { email: 'elaine@thorne.co' },
  to: { password: null }
});
```

#### Form

```tsx
<Form model="account">
  <Input type="email" name="email" placeholder="Email" target />
  <Input type="hidden" name="password" value={null} />

  <button type="submit">Send Confirmation</button>
</Form>
```

### Reset Password

Can be shown after the user clicked the link in the email that was sent by [Forgot Password](#forgot-password).

#### Query

```ts
const { searchParams } = useLocation();
const emailVerificationToken = searchParams.get('token');

await set.account({
  with: { emailVerificationToken },
  to: { password: 'my-new-password' }
});
```

#### Form

```tsx
const { searchParams } = useLocation();
const emailVerificationToken = searchParams.get('token');
const account = use.account.with({ emailVerificationToken });

{account ? (
  <Form model="account" target={{ emailVerificationToken }}>

    {/* Tells password managers which account to update. */}
    <Input type="hidden" name="email" value={account.email} />
    <Input type="password" name="password" placeholder="New Password" />

    <button type="submit">Change Password</button>
  </Form>
) : (
  <span>Your link has expired</span>
)}
```

## Utility Functions

Blade also re-exports a few helpful utility functions for authentication:

### `getSessionCookie`

This function can be used to parse the current `session` cookie inside a trigger.

For example, you could place the trigger below inside the trigger file of a model for
which you would like to log a message every time a record is added.

```ts
import type { FollowingAddTrigger } from "blade/types";
import { getSessionCookie } from 'blade/server/utils';

export const followingAdd: FollowingAddTrigger = async (_, _, options) => {
  const { accountId } = await getSessionCookie(options);
  console.log(`A new record was added by ${accountId}`);
};
```
