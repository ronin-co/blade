# Auth

Blade natively offers the [blade-auth](https://github.com/ronin-co/blade/tree/main/packages/blade-auth) package, which provides utility functions for easily adding different authentication methods to your application, without having to maintain them.

The functionality of the package is built around [Triggers](/models/triggers), which make it possible to capture Blade queries and run custom logic.

## Setup

To enable all default authentication features, create the following files in a directory named `triggers` at the root of your application:

```ts
// account.ts

import type { AddTrigger, GetTrigger, RemoveTrigger } from "blade/types";
import { addAccount, setAccount } from "blade/server/auth";

export const add: AddTrigger = addAccount;
export const set: SetTrigger = setAccount;
```

```ts
// session.ts

import type { AddTrigger, GetTrigger, RemoveTrigger } from "blade/types";
import { addSession, getSession, removeSession } from "blade/server/auth";

export const get: GetTrigger = getSession;
export const add: AddTrigger = addSession;
export const remove: RemoveTrigger = removeSession;
```

Additionally, place the following in your [Schema Definition](/models) located in a `schema/index.ts` file at the root of your project:

```ts
export { Account, Session } from 'blade/server/auth';
```
