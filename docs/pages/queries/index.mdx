# Queries

Programmatically interacting with data in Blade is made possible through its unique query
syntax, designed to allow for accessing data in the most “humane” way possible, as it
closely mimics the English language.

<QuerySyntaxPreview />

To retrieve a list of records, for example, you could run the following:

```ts
export default function Page() {
  const accounts = use.accounts();

  return <div>I am a page</div>;
};
```

If you’d like to retrieve only a specific record, you could do so like this:

```ts
use.account.with.handle('elaine');
```

As you can probably already tell, Blade’s query syntax is quite straightforward to use
while still providing enough flexibility to scale gradually as more advanced assertions
are desired.

## Components

Below, you can find a list of all the different parts of the Blade query syntax.

### Query Type

Learn more about how to perform different actions with queries:

- [Adding Records](/queries/crud#adding-records-add) (`add`)

- [Retrieving Records](/queries/crud#retrieving-records-get) (`get`)

- [Modifying Records](/queries/crud#modifying-records-set) (`set`)

- [Removing Records](/queries/crud#removing-records-remove) (`remove`)

- [Counting Records](/queries/crud#counting-records-count) (`count`)

### Query Target

The second part of every Blade query is its target (“query target”).

Every query is aimed at a particular model, which is addressed using either the **Slug** or the **Plural Slug** of the respective model. Both are located in your [model definition](/models). The `slug` attribute of models is always required, and the `pluralSlug` is auto-generated, but can be overwritten explicitly.

- Using the **Slug** will result in a singular record getting addressed. Specifically, the most recently created record that matches the query.

- Using the **Plural Slug** will result in multiple records getting addressed. Specifically, all existing records that match the provided query, ordered by their creation date.

#### Limitations

- Queries of type `add` currently only support providing a Slug, not a Plural Slug, as only one record can be created at a time. You may create multiple records at once, by executing multiple queries. A query such as `add.accounts()` is therefore not supported, while `add.account()` is supported.

- Queries of type `count` only support providing a Plural Slug, not a Slug, as the query type is used for counting records, and if there is a guarantee that there will be only a single record, counting them is not needed. A query such as `count.blogPost()` is therefore not supported, while `count.blogPosts()` is supported.

### Query Instructions

Learn more about how to access specific records and adjust the behavior of the query:

- Asserting Fields (`with`)

- Paginating Records (`before`, `after`, `limitedTo`)

- Ordering Records (`orderedBy`)

- Resolving Related Records (`using`)

- Selecting Fields (`selecting`)

## Composability

As Blade’s query syntax mimics a plain JavaScript or JSON object in its form, you may choose to expand or compress the individual levels of the object at any position of your choice.

For example, both of these queries perform exactly the same action:

```ts
use.blogPosts.with.slug('new-pricing');

use.blogPosts({
  with: { slug: 'new-pricing' },
});
```

Any level that contains a period (`.`) can instead be a nested object if you decide so. This allows you to structure the query in any way you like, to keep it as simple as possible and as human-readable as possible, even as complexity increases.

## Dot Notation

Additional flexibility is provided as every **key** inside the object can contain dot notation as well.

This is especially useful when addressing nested fields (either of a [relational record](/queries/instructions) or the [Blade metadata](/models/fields#default-fields)) or when writing extremely sophisticated queries, as the syntax continues to remain readable and even easy to augment with comments.

For example, the query below retrieves all records of the model “Blog Post” where the author is matched using a given username/handle, and the record is older than a given date:

```ts
use.blogPosts({
  with: {
    author: { handle: { being: 'elaine' } },
    ronin: { createdAt: { lessThan: new Date() } },
  },
  using: ['author'],
});
```

In order to simplify addressing nested fields, Blade supports “dot notation”, which may be used **on any level of the query**:

```ts
use.blogPosts({
  'with.author.handle.being': 'elaine',
  'with.ronin.createdAt.lessThan': new Date(),
  using: ['author'],
});
```

Another example of placing the “dot notation” on a different level could be:

```ts
use.blogPosts.with({
  'author.handle': 'elaine',
  'author.email': 'elaine@kojima-productions.com',
});
```

Similarily, if you’d like to provide comment augmentation for extremely sophisticated queries, you can easily do so like this:

```ts
use.teams.with({
  // Only retrieve teams of the current Space.
  'space.handle.being': spaceHandle,

  // Exclude the current team.
  'handle.notBeing': teamHandle,

  // Exclude children of the current team.
  team: [{ 'handle.notBeing': teamHandle }, { being: null }],
});
```

## OR Conditions

In certain cases, you might want to express an “OR” condition in Blade’s query syntax, by requiring one of two (or more) possible sub-conditions to match.

Achieving this is only a matter of using **Arrays**, rather than **Objects**, for your queries.

You can think about Blade’s query syntax in the following way:

- Objects require every nested property within them to match.

- Arrays require at least one nested item within them to match.

In the following example, we want to retrieve a record of the “Blog Post” model for which the “author” field matches at least one of two possible values:

```ts
use.blogPost.with.author(['acc_vais0g9rrk995tz0', 'acc_fa0k5kkw35fik9pu']);
```

The array syntax can currently be applied to **any level** inside the `with` [query instruction](/queries/instructions):

```ts
use.accounts.with.handle(['leo', 'juri']);

use.accounts.with.handle([{ endingWith: 'test' }, { startingWith: '1234' }]);

use.accounts.with([{ handle: { being: 'today' } }, { name: { endingWith: 'lamprecht' } }]);
```

You can even use it on multiple different nesting levels at once:

```ts
use.accounts.with([{ handle: { being: ['juri', 'leo'] } }, { name: { endingWith: 'lamprecht' } }]);
```
