### Revalidation (Stale-While-Revalidate, SWR)

Blade intelligently keeps your data up-to-date for you, so no extra state management is needed for the output of your read queries. The data is refreshed:

- When a [mutation](#usemutation-client) happens (in the same DB transaction as the mutation).
- Every 5 seconds while the window is in focus.
- When the window gains focus.
- When the device was offline and goes back online.

Even the application itself is revalidated. Whenever you deploy a new version of your web app, Blade will detect the drift and synchronize itself between server and client, resolving the new client assets in the browser and replacing the UI with the updated code. This currently happens immediately, but will soon be limited to when the browser window is inactive.

Lastly, even React iself is revalidated. If you upgrade React, Blade will unmount the old React on the client, mount the new React, and then re-mount your application.
