# Models

The schema of your database consistents of multiple models. Each model uses fields to define the shape of a particular kind of record in your database.

For example, your database schema might contain a model called "Account" representing a user, and a model called "Team", representing a group of users.

When using Blade, your database schema is defined in code, which provides maximum flexibility and benefits such as **revisions**, **reviews** and **reverts** via Git. This page provides an overview of how to define your database schema in code.

## Getting Started

Start by creating the file (in your project's root directory) that will contain the model definitions for your project:

```bash title="Terminal"
mkdir schema
touch schema/index.ts
```

A model is defined using the `model()` function provided under the `blade/schema` path. The path also provides all field type primitives, such as `string()`, `number()`, or `blob()`.

Here is an example of a basic schema definition:

```ts title="schema/index.ts"
import { model, string, date } from 'blade/schema';

export const Account = model({
  slug: 'account',

  fields: {
    name: string(),
    handle: string(),
    verifiedAt: date()
  }
});
```

In the example above, we defined a model named `Account` with three fields: `name`, `handle`, and `verifiedAt`. Each field is defined using a key-value pair where the key is the slug of the field and the value is the type of the field. See all available field types in the [Field Types](#Field%20Types) section.

Once you've defined your models locally, you can compare them to the current state of your database like this:

```bash title="Terminal"
blade diff
```

Running the command above will produce a so-called "migration protocol" in the `schema` directory. This protocol contains all the steps required to update your database to match your local schema definition.

To apply the changes to your database, run the following command:

```bash title="Terminal"
blade apply
```

Afterward, you can start sending queries to your database that make use of the newly added (or updated) models in your database schema.

In the future, if you'd like to immediately apply your local changes to your database without first reviewing them, run thhis command:

```bash title="Terminal"
blade diff --apply
```

Like this, the generated migration protocol will be applied immediately.

## Field Types

The following types can be used to define fields in a model:

<Table>
  <TableHeader>
    <TableRow>
      <TableHead className="w-[100px]">Function</TableHead>
      <TableHead>Type</TableHead>
    </TableRow>
  </TableHeader>
  <TableBody>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>`string()`</TableCell>
      <TableCell>String field</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>`number()`</TableCell>
      <TableCell>Number field</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>`boolean()`</TableCell>
      <TableCell>Boolean field</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>`date()`</TableCell>
      <TableCell>Timestamp field</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>`blob()`</TableCell>
      <TableCell>Binary object field</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>`json()`</TableCell>
      <TableCell>JSON field</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
  </TableBody>
</Table>

## Link Fields

You can define the relationship of a field to another model like so:

```ts title="schema/index.ts"
import { model, string, date, link } from 'blade/schema';

export const Account = model({
  slug: 'account',

  fields: {
    name: string(),
    handle: string(),
    verifiedAt: date()
  }
});

export const Member = model({
  slug: 'member',

  fields: {
    account: link({
      target: 'account'
    })
  }
});
```

In the example above, we defined an additional model named `Member` with a fields named `account` that references the `Account` model.

## What if I have multiple repositories?

Once you apply your local schema definition to your database, your local schema definition will be available in your types package (i.e. `@ronin/YOUR_SPACE_HANDLE`) too. See [TypeScript Types](/docs/types) for more information.

The types package is a separate package that you can install in your other repositories to access the same type definitions in those repositories.
