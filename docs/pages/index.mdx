# Introduction

Blade is a React framework for building highly dynamic web applications.

Applications built with Blade are fast across all vectors: The first load is instant,
while interactions are instant too.

By following the principles of edge compute, Blade meets your users where they are, instead
of making them come to you. Your application and the data of your users are pushed as
close as possible to them, instead of requiring them retrieve it.

In practice, this means that loading animations of any form (spinners, skeletons, etc)
are avoided, ensuring the snappiest and thereby most joyful experience for end users,
similar to how a native app feels.

## Data Model

The core of Blade is its query syntax, which allows for instantly reading and writing
data.

It combines common data querying patterns of web apps into a syntax that is more powerful
than SQL, by making it possible to express complex operations with less code, resulting in
a more effective tool for web apps.

In its simplest form, reading a list of records would look like this:

```typescript
const records = use.accounts();
```

While writing a record looks like this:

```typescript
const { add } = useMutation();

add.account.with.handle('test');
```

This lets you focus on the user experience of your application instead of adding
REST APIs, data state management libraries, React server functions, or similar.

Blade manages the state of your data for you. Any mutation you apply is instantly
reflected across all read queries, and propagated to other clients in the background.

## Hooks

In general, just like with the data model described above, the majority of programmatic
API of Blade revolves around the concept of [Hooks](https://react.dev/reference/react/hooks):

- `use`: Read data
- `useMutation`: Write data
- `useLocation`: Mimics `window.location`
- `useNavigator`: Mimics `window.navigator`
- `useRedirect`: Change the page
- `useCookie`: Read and write cookies
- `useParams`: Read dynamic path segments
- `usePopulatePathname`: Populate dynamic path segments
- `usePagination`: Get the next/previous page of records
- `usePaginationBuffer`: Concatenate paginated lists
- `useMetadata`: Set the contents of `<head>`
- `useCountOf`: Like `use`, but counts records
- `useBatch`: Run multiple `use` queries at once
- `useLinkEvents`: Applies the event handlers of the `<Link>` component
- `useQueryState`: Like `useState`, but for URL query params

## Get Started

Start building your first application with Blade by running the following command to create a new example application:

```bash
npm create blade
```

A new directory named `blade-example` will be created as a result, which contains your newly created application.

To start developing it, you can now run this command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

That's it! 🎉 You can now start working on your application.

## Data Storage

By default, when you run Blade the first time, it will generate an [SQLite](https://sqlite.org) database
for you and place it in the `.blade` directory of your project. All of your data will then be
persisted in that directory.

Now that your database exists, you can start [defining its schema](/models). As an example, we could
add the following model (which is similar to a table in SQL):

```ts
export const Account = model({
  slug: 'account',

  fields: {
    name: string(),
  }
});
```

Next, you can run apply the model to your database by running this command:

```bash
blade diff --apply
```

Once your database schema has been updated, your can begin inserting data. For example, you
could execute write queries with the [`useMutation`](/hooks#usemutation-client) hook like this:

```tsx
import { useMutation } from 'blade/client/hooks';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { add } = useMutation();

  const buttonClicked = () => {
    await add.account.with({ name: 'Elaine' });
  }

  return (
    <button onClick={buttonClicked}>Insert data</button>
  );
};
```

That's it! 🚀

You've successfully inserted data. As you can see when running this code (you can just run it
multiple times), the `add.account` query returns the new record you just created.

To read the data across different pages, you could then write read queries with
the [`use`](/hooks#use-server) hook. In other words, `useMutation` handles write queries, while
read queries are handled by `use`.
