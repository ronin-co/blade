# Introduction

Blade is a React framework for building highly dynamic web applications.

Applications built with Blade are fast across all vectors: The first load is instant,
while interactions are instant too.

By following the principle of [Edge First](#), Blade meets your users where they are, instead
of making them come to you. Your application and the data of your users are pushed as
close as possible to them, instead of requiring them retrieve it.

In practice, this means that loading animations of any form (spinners, skeletons, etc)
are avoided, ensuring the snappiest and thereby most joyful experience for end users,
similar to how a native app feels.

## API

The core of Blade is its [Query Syntax](#), which allows for instantly reading and writing
data.

It combines common data querying patterns of web apps into a syntax that is more powerful
than SQL, by making it possible to express complex operations with less code, resulting in
a more effective tool for web apps.

In its simplest form, reading a list of records would look like this:

```typescript
const records = use.accounts();
```

While writing a record looks like this:

```typescript
const { add } = useMutation();

add.account.with.handle('test');
```

This lets you focus on the user experience of your application instead of adding
REST APIs, data state management libraries, React server functions, or similar.

Blade manages the state of your data for you. Any mutation you apply is instantly
reflected across all read queries, and propagated to other clients in the background.

## Get Started

To get started with RONIN after signing up, first [define a model](/docs/models) and apply it to your database.

Next, to query your RONIN database, start by creating a new App (such as “Website”) in the “Apps” section of your space on the dashboard (left sidebar), which will provide you with a token.

After that, install the [RONIN client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ronin) on your project:

```bash title="Terminal"
npm install ronin
```

<AlertCard>
  RONIN currently only supports [Bun](https://bun.sh) during development.
</AlertCard>

Once the package is installed, make sure to define a `RONIN_TOKEN` environment variable on your project that contains the App Token you've created on the dashboard. The RONIN client will automatically make use of this environment variable to authenticate your queries (you can alternatively pass the token using [config](/docs/client)).

Lastly, you can then start sending [queries](/docs/queries) to your RONIN database:

```ts
import { add } from 'ronin';

await add.account.with({
    name: 'Elaine Jones',
    handle: 'elaine',
});
```

In the example above, we're adding a new record for the "account" model. Depending on the models you've added to your database, make sure to replace "account" with the slug of the model you've added. Additionally, the fields must match the fields you've defined on your respective model.

That's it! You can now start using RONIN to build your application!

Next up, we recommend learning more about the [RONIN query syntax](/docs/queries), which allows you to construct the ideal database queries for your project.
