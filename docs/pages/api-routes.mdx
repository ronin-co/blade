# API Routes

Reading data in Blade happens through the [`use`](/hooks#use-server) hook in layouts and
pages, while modifying data happens through the [`useMutation`](/hooks#usemutation-client) hook
in interactive components.

To run arbitrary code on the server for reads or mutations, [Triggers](/models/triggers)
can be used (most commonly Triggers of type "During").

This means that all interactions with the server from the client are happening through
mutations. As a result, no REST APIs are required to be written.

The only case in which you should therefore consider exposing a REST API is if you would
like other clients (such as an iOS app or a third-party app) to access your application.
For those cases, Blade automatically generates a REST API at the URL path `/api` that
exposes your [Triggers](/models/triggers) through an auto-generated request schema, which
can be enabled by adding this export to your Trigger file:

```typescript
export const exposed = true;
```

In general, you should never interact with those APIs from your Blade application, since
reading data from an API on the client-side causes a network waterfall and thereby a
loading animation. Additionally, writing data through an API requires custom client-side
state management, which Blade is designed to abstract away through its mutation syntax
and automatic state management.

Furthermore, Blade performs numerous internal optimizations for the [`use`](/hooks#use-server)
and [`useMutation`](/hooks#usemutation-client) hooks, such as combining all queries of a
page render (even across layouts) into a single database transaction for maximum
performance efficiency.

## Custom API Routes

It is highly recommended to rely on Blade's auto-generated REST APIs if you would like
to expose your application's data to third-party clients, in order to keep your codebase
as clean as possible.

In the rare case that you need to mount an API with a specific request signature to your Blade application, you can add a `router.ts` file at the root of your application and place a [Hono](https://hono.dev) app inside of it, which will then be mounted by Blade:

```typescript
import { Hono } from "hono";

const app = new Hono()
  .post('/some-path', (c) => c.text('Testing'));

export default app;
```

If needed, you can also run queries via the `c.var.client` context variable, which contains an instance of the Blade client that allows for running Blade queries.

However, note that paths mounted in this Hono app cannot interface with the rest of your Blade app (like your pages) in any way. They are only meant to be used in edge cases where you cannot rely on Blade's [trigger](https://ronin.co/docs/models/triggers) feature. In other words, your Hono app and your Blade app are two different apps running on the same domain.
