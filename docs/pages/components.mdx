# Components

## `Link`

When writing Blade apps, [anchor elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/a) should only be used for linking to external URLs.

For linking to URLs within the same application, use the native `Link` component instead:

```tsx
import { Link } from 'blade/client/components';

<Link href="/another-page">click me</Link>
```

### Props

<ParamField path="href" type="string" isRequired>
    A string or `URL` object containing the pathname and search params of the
    destination page.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="segments" type="object">
    An object containing key/value pairs of dynamic segments that should be
    used to populate the `href`. For example, if the `href` is `/teams/[handle]` and the
    `segments` prop is `{ handle: 'engineering' }`, the destination page would be
    `/teams/engineering`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="prefetch" type="boolean" defaultValue="true">
    A boolean indicating whether the link should be prefetched. Read more about prefetching below.
</ParamField>

- Additionally, all attributes of
  [anchor elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/a)
  are supported as props of `Link` and will be forwarded to the underlying auto-generated
  anchor element.

### Prefetching

On desktop, when a cursor enters a `Link` element (hover), the destination page will be
loaded by Blade in the background, to ensure that, by the time the page transition happens
(when the element is clicked), the page transition will be instant.

Similarily, on mobile devices, the destination page will be prefetched upon the start of
the touch action, meaning when the screen is pressed. When the touch action ends (e.g.
the finger is lifted), the transition begins.

In the future, links will also be prefetched when the page that contains them is loaded.

## `Form`

Storing data in Blade is done by executing write queries with
the [useMutation](/hooks#usemutation-client) hook. It makes it possible to construct any
kind of logic for writing records, including building forms.

If you are specifically implementing a form, Blade also offers a native `Form` component,
which makes building forms even easier. The component invokes `useMutation` internally.

For example, it could look like this:

```tsx
import { Form } from 'blade/client/components';

<Form model="account" redirect="/dashboard">
  <input type="text" name="email" placeholder="Email" />
  <input type="text" name="password" placeholder="Password" />

  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</Form>
```

If the button at the end of the form is pressed, the following query will be executed,
with `xxx` being the values that were provided in the inputs.

```ts
add.account.with({
  email: 'xxx',
  password: 'xxx'
});
```

As a result, a new record for the `account` model will be added with the provided values,
and the page will change to `/dashboard` afterward.

Due to how [useMutation](/hooks#usemutation-client) is designed, the form submission will
be executed with maximum efficiency: The write query will be executed in the same
database transaction as the read queries of the `/dashboard` page, and only the
`/dashboard` page will be rendered — not the current page.

To avoid changing the page after the form submission, simply leave out the `redirect` property.

## `Image`

Building a fast web application that instantly provides joy to its users whenever it is
accessed (rather than introducing delays) typically requires paying attention to a number
of different components.

Blade aims to automatically provide you with the optimizations you need to guarantee the
fastest experience possible, additionally letting you fine-tune those improvements where necessary.

One of those optimizations is that images are **displayed instantaneously**, which Blade
ensures via a number of different features available for images (`image` [MIME type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types) data) stored in the **Blob** field type.

### Image Metadata

When retrieving records that contain fields of type “Blob”, you will be provided with a
value that looks similar to the following for each of those fields:

```ts
export interface Blob {
  key: string;
  /** The URL of the binary object. */
  src: string;
  meta: {
    /** The byte size of the binary object. */
    size: number;
    /** The pixel width of the image, if the binary object is an image. */
    width: number;
    /** The pixel height of the image, if the binary object is an image. */
    height: number;
    /** The MIME type of the binary object. */
    type: string;
  };
  /** A base64 encoded preview to display while the image is loading, if the binary object is an image. */
  placeholder: {
    base64: string;
  };
}
```

### Image Placeholders

If you are building a web application, in order to ensure the smoothest possible experience
for the people making use of your application, we strongly advice displaying a low-quality
blurred version of every image, until the full image has finished loading.

Like this, you can avoid empty white gaps in your page, and instead always display something
that at least remotely resembles what the image will look like, until the image is available
in its entirety. At this point the image can overlay the blurred low-quality version.

The `Image` component does this automatically, if you provide it with a `placeholder`
property, which you can obtain directly from the respective Blob field.

### Image Performance

To ensure that the final image finishes loading as quickly as possible, it is recommended to have its size automatically optimized by Blade, or your deployment provider.

Other additional options can be used as well, in order to guarantee the most ideal experience possible:

<ParamField path="w" type="number">
    The desired pixel width of the image.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="h" type="number">
    The desired pixel height of the image.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="q" type="number">
    The desired quality of the image (number between 1 and 100).
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="fm" type="avif | webp | png | jpeg">
    The file format of the image.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="fit" type="cover | contain | inside | outside | fill">
    How the image should be fit to its frame.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="blur" type="number">
    The strength of a [gaussian blur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_blur) effect applied to the image (number between 0.3 and 1000).
</ParamField>

### Download

By default, all images are opened inside the browser when accessing them. If you wish to download them when accessing the image URL, add `?download=true` or `download=desired-filename.png` to the URL. This will instruct browsers (set the `Content-Disposition` header to `attachment`) to download the image.
