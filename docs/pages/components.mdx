# Hooks

## `Link` (Client)

When writing Blade apps, [anchor elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/a) should only be used for linking to external URLs.

For linking to URLs within the same application, use the native `Link` component instead:

```tsx
import { Link } from '@ronin/blade/client/components';

<Link href="/another-page">click me</Link>
```

The following props are available:

- `href`: A string or `URL` object containing the pathname and search params of the
  destination page.
- `segments`: An object containing key/value pairs of dynamic segments that should be
  used to populate the `href`. For example, if the `href` is `/teams/[handle]` and the
  `segments` prop is `{ handle: 'engineering' }`, the destination page would be
  `/teams/engineering`.
- `prefetch`: A boolean indicating whether the link should be prefetched. Defaults to
  `true`. Read more about prefetching below.
- Additionally, all attributes of
  [anchor elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/a)
  are supported as props of `Link` and will be forwarded to the underlying auto-generated
  anchor element.

##### Prefetching

On desktop, when a cursor enters a `Link` element (hover), the destination page will be
loaded by Blade in the background, to ensure that, by the time the page transition happens
(when the element is clicked), the page transition will be instant.

Similarily, on mobile devices, the destination page will be prefetched upon the start of
the touch action, meaning when the screen is pressed. When the touch action ends (e.g.
the finger is lifted), the transition begins.

In the future, links will also be prefetched when the page that contains them is loaded.
