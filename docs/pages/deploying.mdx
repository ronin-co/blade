# Deploying

Blade was designed from the ground up to be easy to deploy anywhere. Its build
output follows a simple platform-agnostic structure that can be easily adapted
to any production environment. Most environments are natively supported without
any configuration.

Before deploying your application, you can compile it with the following command:

```bash
blade build
```

This command will generate a directory named `.blade` in the current directory,
which contains the compiled application. Specifically, the compilation process
includes bundling dependencies, tree-shaking, eliminating dead code, and
minfiying it.

## Providers

After you have compiled your application, you can serve it using any of the following
natively supported deployment providers. If your desired provider is included in the list,
you don't need to provide any additional configuration during deployment.

In general, we recommend deploying Blade to a provider that allows you to run your
application "at the edge", meaning as close as possible to your users. Typically, if
your user base is global, you should choose a provider that has a global network of
data centers that can run many instances of your application spread across the globe.

Like that, your users will have the smallest latency possible when accessing your application,
ensuring the best performance and thereby the best user experience.

Typically, this means choosing a provider that supports primitives such as edge functions
or workers (stateless), since primitives such as serverless functions or containers
(stateful) tend to be available in only one or only a few geographical regions, causing
higher latency for your global user base.

If your user base is not global, however (e.g. if you are deploying a web app for purchasing
public transport tickets in a specific country), deploying Blade to a provider that only
supports a single region or very few regions (e.g. using serverless functions or containers)
is perfectly fine, since your user base will be close by.

### Cloudflare

Deploying Blade to [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com) is currently
the recommended way to deploy Blade applications. Cloudflare pioneered the concept of
edge computing with the invention of Workers and is therefore optimized to run your
Blade application as close to your users as possible.

To get started, create a Cloudflare account, create a new Workers project, select the
Git repository that contains your Blade application, and follow the instructions on screen.

Blade will automatically detect Cloudflare based on the presence of the `WORKERS_CI`
environment variable (which Cloudflare provides by default) and adjust its build output
accordingly. You can also provide the environment variable yourself if you want to test
the build output locally: `WORKERS_CI=1 blade build`.

### Netlify

Like with Cloudflare, [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) is a great choice for deploying
your Blade application, due to the fact that Netlify's Edge Functions are powered
by [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/subhosting) under the hood, which runs your Blade
application as close to your users as possible.

To get started, create a Netlify account, create a new project, select the
Git repository that contains your Blade application, and follow the instructions on screen.

Blade will automatically detect Cloudflare based on the presence of the `NETLIFY`
environment variable (which Cloudflare provides by default) and adjust its build output
accordingly. You can also provide the environment variable yourself if you want to test
the build output locally: `NETLIFY=1 blade build`.

### Vercel

Deploying Blade to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) gets you an exceptionally well designed
developer experience and a extremely performant global network of data centers.

Vercel's latest [Fluid compute](https://vercel.com/fluid) technology supports deploying
your Blade application to 1 geographical region on the Free plan and 3 geographical
regions on the Pro plan, with more regions available on the Enterprise plan. Those regions
can be picked from a list of [18 regions](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/regions).

This means that your Blade application can run in up to 3 regions at the same time,
assuming you are on the Pro plan, making Vercel an excellent choice for deploying Blade to
an application with a user base available in a particular country or continent.

Due to Blade's "edge-first" design, however, 3 regions are not sufficient for serving a global
user base when using Blade specifically. As soon as [Fluid compute](https://vercel.com/fluid)
becomes available for Edge Functions, Blade will be able to run in all 18 regions
at the same time.

### Containers

If you would like to run Blade on container-based platform like [Fly.io](https://fly.io)
or [Railway](https://railway.app), you can do so by running the following command after
compiling your application:

```bash
blade serve
```

Afterward, a HTTP server listening on port 3000 will be started for you, through which
your Blade application can be accessed. The command serves your application directly
from the `.blade` directory, without making use of any other files.

A custom port may be provided using the `--port` option:

```bash
blade serve --port 8080
```

Note that Blade does not support terminating TLS (HTTPS) connections, so you must run a
proxy in front of your application that takes care of that for you. Platforms such as
Fly.io, for example, do so automatically. Additionally, Blade does not perform compression
and thereby requires providers to do so.

Here's a full example of a Dockerfile for deploying Blade:

```txt
FROM oven/bun:1.2.5 as base
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

FROM base AS install
RUN mkdir -p /temp/dev
COPY package.json bun.lock /temp/dev/
RUN cd /temp/dev && bun install --frozen-lockfile

FROM base AS build
COPY --from=install /temp/dev/node_modules node_modules
COPY . .
RUN bun run build

FROM oven/bun:1.2.5 AS release
COPY --from=build /usr/src/app/node_modules node_modules
COPY --from=build /usr/src/app/packages/private/.blade .blade
COPY --from=build /usr/src/app/packages/private/package.json .

USER bun
EXPOSE 3000/tcp
ENTRYPOINT [ "bun", "run", "serve" ]
```
