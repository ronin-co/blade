# Deploying

Blade was designed from the ground up to be easy to deploy anywhere. Its build
output follows a simple platform-agnostic structure that can be easily adapted
to any production environment. Most environments are natively supported without
any configuration.

Before deploying your application, you can compile it with the following command:

```bash
blade build
```

This command will generate a directory named `.blade` in the current directory,
which contains the compiled application. Specifically, the compilation process
includes bundling dependencies, tree-shaking, eliminating dead code, and
minfiying it.

## Providers

After you have compiled your application, you can serve it using any of the following
natively supported deployment providers. If your desired provider is included in the list,
you don't need to provide any additional configuration during deployment.

In general, we recommend deploying Blade to a provider that allows you to run your
application "at the edge", meaning as close as possible to your users. Typically, if
your user base is global, you should choose a provider that has a global network of
data centers that can run many instances of your application spread across the globe.

Like that, your users will have the smallest latency possible when accessing your application,
ensuring the best performance and thereby the best user experience.
