# RONIN Blade

This package renders [React](https://react.dev) at the edge.

## Setup

To get started with Blade, run the following command:

```bash
npx @ronin/blade init
```

Afterward, enter the newly created directory and install the dependencies:

```bash
cd blade-example
bun install
```

Lastly, start the development server:

```bash
bun run dev
```

## Contributing

To start contributing code, first make sure you have [Bun](https://bun.sh) installed, which is a JavaScript runtime.

Next, [clone the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) and install its dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

Once that's done, link the package to make it available to all of your local projects:

```bash
bun link
```

Inside your project, you can then run the following command, which is similar to `bun add @ronin/blade` or `npm install @ronin/blade`, except that it doesn't install `@ronin/blade` from npm, but instead uses your local clone of the package:

```bash
bun link @ronin/blade
```

If your project is not yet compatible with [Bun](https://bun.sh), feel free to replace all of the occurrences of the word `bun` in the commands above with `npm` instead.

You will just need to make sure that, once you [create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request#creating-the-pull-request) on the current repo, it will not contain a `package-lock.json` file, which is usually generated by npm. Instead, we're using the `bun.lockb` file for this purpose (locking sub dependencies to a certain version).

### Running Tests

Before you create a pull request on the `blade` repo, it is advised to run its tests in order to ensure everything works as expected:

```bash
# Run all tests
bun run test

# Alternatively, run a single test
bun run test -- -t 'your test name'
```
